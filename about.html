            <p class="dark">
              My name is Kyle Ng. I currently attend Irvington High School as a Freshman, Class of 2022. I love Robotics, Kung Fu, and Percussion!
            <p>
              In Robotics, I strive to bring my students the best possible experience learning! To truly fufill this mission, I make sure that a curriculum is created that is appropriate to each student that I teach.
              <br>
              <br>
              In Kung Fu, I have learned to always strive to be the best person I can be no matter what other people are doing. I believe that his has carried into the other areas of my life as it is my main philosophy.
              <br>
              <br>
              In Percussion, I am dedicated to having fun with my friends and enjoy playing in the battery section. I also love my family and loved ones as they are the world to me.
