            <h3>Teaching</h3>
            <p>As a Robotics Teacher, I understand that each student learns differently. Because of this, I regularly create curriculum specifically tailored for specific groups that I work with.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I believe each student has potential to become great and reach their full capability with practice and a determined mindset!</p>
